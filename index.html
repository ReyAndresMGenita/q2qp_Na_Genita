                <article>
                    <p>PPSA was established in 2015 by the Philippines' Department of Agriculture to help address the pressing issues in agriculture by providing a platform for various stakeholders to engage, discuss, collaborate and bring to life initiatives and best practices of individual companies into a collective action aimed at improving the lives of smallholder farmers.</p>
                    <p>The PPSA was catalyzed by Grow Asia to bring together different sectors and actors to co-develop and scale initiatives to address key issues in agriculture.</p>
